# Coursera Change Hosts Program

Coursera is a good platform to learn all sorts of knowledge from many international universities. There is a question that many students who are from China and use the Chinese networks can't watch the learning videos on the Coursera platform. Therefore, I try searching for some methods to watch them on Chinese networks.

The method is easy. It is that changing Changing the Hosts file of the system makes why I program the python project that helps them learn more knowledge in the Hosts file of the system make the videos play. But some students are not good at computers. That is the reason why I program the python project that helps them learn more knowledge in the Coursera platform by watching the videos.
