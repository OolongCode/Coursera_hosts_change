# Coursera Change Hosts Program

Coursera is a good platform to learn all sorts of knowledge from many international universities. There is a question that many students who is from China and use the Chinese networks can't watch the learning videos of the Coursera platform. Therefore, I try searching some methods to watch them in Chinese networks.

The method is easily. It is that changing the Hosts file of the system make the videos play. But there are some students who are not good at computers. That is a reason why I program the python project that help them learn more knowledge in Coursera platform by watching the videos.
